<!--   l. 11   --><p class='indent'>   This is the first post in a series about blogging with LaTeX using  <a href='https://tug.org/tex4ht/'>TeX4ht</a>. I
originally set it up as a showcase of TeX4ht’s features for the  <a href='https://tug.org/tug2021/'>TUG 2021</a> conference.
Unfortunately, I didn’t get to present it in the end—I ran out of time during my
allocated slot, and I also didn’t manage to finish all the posts I had planned by the
deadline. Fast forward to February 2025, and I thought, why not finally complete this
series? Better late than never, right?

<!--   l. 25   --><p class='noindent'>I really enjoy writing my documents in LaTeX, and I want to offer a solid alternative
to other markup languages like Markdown or HTML. The beauty of LaTeX lies in its
incredible flexibility—it lets you structure your documents exactly how you want,
without being tied down by the limitations of more rigid systems. Whether you’re
writing a quick report or a full-blown book, LaTeX gives you the tools to make it
look polished and professional.
</p><!--   l. 32   --><p class='indent'>   Of course, LaTeX isn’t for everyone, and that’s totally fine! Some people prefer
the instant visual feedback you get with WYSIWYG editors like Word or Google
Docs, and there’s absolutely nothing wrong with that. Others might like
the simplicity of plain text but find LaTeX’s syntax too complicated or
                                                                  

                                                                  
even a bit ugly—and hey, that’s fair too. Markdown and other lightweight
markup languages are great alternatives, and there’s no shame in using
them.
</p><!--   l. 39   --><p class='indent'>   Let’s be honest, LaTeX can be pretty complex, and a lot of people won’t even
scratch the surface of what it can do. And that’s okay—not everyone needs
that level of control or customization. Personally, though, I’ve never been
a fan of Word or Markdown. Word feels too restrictive for my taste, and
Markdown, while simple, just doesn’t give me the power I need. That’s
why I’ve turned to LaTeX as my go-to tool. It’s my way of creating an
alternative for myself and others who feel the same way—people who want more
flexibility and precision without being tied down by the limitations of other
tools.
</p><!--   l. 48   --><p class='indent'>   One of the coolest things about LaTeX is how customizable it is. You can create
your own environments and commands, which is a game-changer when it comes to
organizing your content. This is super handy for big projects like theses or
books, where you need everything to be consistent, but it’s also great for
smaller stuff like articles or essays. Plus, once you’ve set up your custom
commands, you can reuse them across different documents, saving you a ton of
time.
</p><!--   l. 56   --><p class='indent'>   Another reason I love LaTeX is the sheer number of packages available.
These packages let you do pretty much anything you can think of. Need
to draw diagrams? Check out <span class='ec-lmtt-10'>TikZ </span>or <span class='ec-lmtt-10'>PGFPlots</span>. Writing a math-heavy
paper? <span class='ec-lmtt-10'>Amsmath </span>has got your back. Managing references? <span class='ec-lmtt-10'>BibLaTeX </span>makes it a
breeze. The possibilities are endless, and it’s one of the reasons LaTeX is so
powerful.
</p><!--   l. 63   --><p class='indent'>   Now, some people say that converting LaTeX to HTML is a pain, but honestly,
it’s not that hard if you know what you’re doing. I’m the author of  <a href='https://tug.org/tex4ht/'>TeX4ht</a>, a
tool that makes this process a lot smoother. It’s a great way to make your
content more accessible online without losing the precision and beauty of
LaTeX.

<!--   l. 71   --><p class='noindent'>In the upcoming posts, we’ll dive into how TeX4ht works and how to configure it to
generate HTML files that play nicely with static site generators. After that, I’ll share
how I used Jekyll to build this series of posts. Finally, we’ll wrap things up by
exploring how to use GitHub Actions to automatically rebuild your website whenever
you update your LaTeX documents.
